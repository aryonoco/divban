Recipes that start with `#!` are called shebang recipes, and are executed by saving the recipe body to a file and running it. This lets you write recipes in different languages:

```js
polyglot: python js perl sh ruby nu

python:
  #!/usr/bin/env python3
  print('Hello from python!')

js:
  #!/usr/bin/env node
  console.log('Greetings from JavaScript!')

perl:
  #!/usr/bin/env perl
  print "Larry Wall says Hi!\n";

sh:
  #!/usr/bin/env sh
  hello='Yo'
  echo "$hello from a shell script!"

nu:
  #!/usr/bin/env nu
  let hello = 'Hola'
  echo $"($hello) from a nushell script!"

ruby:
  #!/usr/bin/env ruby
  puts "Hello from ruby!"
```
```shell
$ just polyglot
Hello from python!
Greetings from JavaScript!
Larry Wall says Hi!
Yo from a shell script!
Hola from a nushell script!
Hello from ruby!
```

On Unix-like operating systems, including Linux and MacOS, shebang recipes are executed by saving the recipe body to a file in a temporary directory, marking the file as executable, and executing it. The OS then parses the shebang line into a command line and invokes it, including the path to the file. For example, if a recipe starts with `#!/usr/bin/env bash`, the final command that the OS runs will be something like `/usr/bin/env bash /tmp/PATH_TO_SAVED_RECIPE_BODY`.

Shebang line splitting is operating system dependent. When passing a command with arguments, you may need to tell `env` to split them explicitly by using the `-S` flag:

```js
run:
  #!/usr/bin/env -S bash -x
  ls
```

Windows does not support shebang lines. On Windows, `just` splits the shebang line into a command and arguments, saves the recipe body to a file, and invokes the split command and arguments, adding the path to the saved recipe body as the final argument. For example, on Windows, if a recipe starts with `#! py`, the final command the OS runs will be something like `py C:\Temp\PATH_TO_SAVED_RECIPE_BODY`.
