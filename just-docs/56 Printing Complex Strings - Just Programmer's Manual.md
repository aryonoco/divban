`echo` can be used to print strings, but because it processes escape sequences, like `\n`, and different implementations of `echo` recognize different escape sequences, using `printf` is often a better choice.

`printf` takes a C-style format string and any number of arguments, which are interpolated into the format string.

This can be combined with indented, triple quoted strings to emulate shell heredocs.

Substitution complex strings into recipe bodies with `{…}` can also lead to trouble as it may be split by the shell into multiple arguments depending on the presence of whitespace and quotes. Exporting complex strings as environment variables and referring to them with `"$NAME"`, note the double quotes, can also help.

Putting all this together, to print a string verbatim to standard output, with all its various escape sequences and quotes undisturbed:

```js
export FOO := '''
  a complicated string with
  some dis\tur\bi\ng escape sequences
  and "quotes" of 'different' kinds
'''

bar:
  printf %s "$FOO"
```
